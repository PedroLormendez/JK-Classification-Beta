# Jenkinson - Collison automated gridded classification for Python
This is an adapted version for python of the __Jenkinson - Collison__ automated classfication based on the original Lamb Weather Types. This gridded version is based on the application made by [Otero](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-017-3705-y) (2018) using a moving central gridded point with  that allows to compute the circulation types on a gridded Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) domain.
